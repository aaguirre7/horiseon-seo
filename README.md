## About The Challange

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](./assets/images/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)

This week is an odd-numbered week, so your Challenge is an on-the-job ticket, which means you'll begin with starter code that you need to modify. This week's challenge involves a very important aspect of web development: accessibility.

One of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers is to take existing code and refactor it (recall that to refactor code is to improve it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. In this Challenge, a marketing agency has hired you to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.

Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities can't access their website.

Even though accessibility is a broad topic that can include complex requirements, your tech lead has given you a small list of specific criteria to satisfy the project. These criteria are documented in the Acceptance Criteria section.

To impress clients, you should always go the extra mile and improve the codebase for long-term sustainability. For example, make sure that all links are functioning correctly. Also, rework the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

What was done:

Both index and css files where commented and fixed image files, also this readme was created.
